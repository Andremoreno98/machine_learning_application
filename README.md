Different Projects using Machine Learning algorithms

In this project, different machine learning algorithms for regression and data classification were tested. 
Data from banks and companies were used to test data preparation techniques prior to model training. 
The prediction accuracy of the algorithms were visualized and compared through python libraries. 
At the end of this project, a Medicine recognition and segmentation model was trained through the YoloV5 model and keras.
